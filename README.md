# Mini Chat Assistant

**Time Limit: 2 Hours**

## Overview
Build a simplified chat interface that simulates a conversation with an AI assistant. This test evaluates your SwiftUI skills, MVVM architecture understanding, and ability to create clean, maintainable code.

## Requirements
### Core Features (Must Have)
1. **Chat Interface**: Display messages in a scrollable list
2. **Message Input**: Text field with send button
3. **Mock AI Responses**: Simulate AI responses with predefined logic
4. **Message Types**: Support user and assistant message bubbles with different styling
5. **Auto-scroll**: Automatically scroll to newest messages

### Technical Requirements
- Use **SwiftUI** for all UI components
- Implement **MVVM pattern** with proper separation of concerns
- Handle basic **error states** (empty messages, etc.)
- Use **async/await** for simulated network delays
- Implement proper **state management**

### âœ… Features Implemented

- [x] **Mock AI Service** â€“ Simulates an AI response system with network delay, random errors, and context-aware replies (greetings, questions, code-related, or default)
- [x] **Chat ViewModel** â€“ Manages chat state, handles user input, communicates asynchronously with the AI service, and updates UI state including loading and error messages
